\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A simple, dynamic octree to be used for finding the neighbours of a boid in a flocking system Modifications of the origional source code are to implement ngl vectors as well as the specific data required for the flocking system. It is also modififed so that a leaf node may contain mroe than one data point, this is necessary for its use in the flockign system. This required a major overhaul of the getPointsInsideSphere method. \item\end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
