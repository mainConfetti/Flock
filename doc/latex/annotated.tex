\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classBoid}{Boid} (A class to contain all relevant data and methods for a boid in a flocking system. The class contains data such as position and velocity and methods that manipulate this data such as \hyperlink{classBoid_aa1144dbf8050c06e5a89db5f84411dd6}{setTarget()}, \hyperlink{classBoid_aa2b619d85612051c88b2e7cc67ac0115}{setSteering()} and \hyperlink{classBoid_ad84ed9152d035b542921547f289024eb}{move()}. the methods combine to form a flocking behaviour as set out by Craig Reynolds (1986) )}{\pageref{classBoid}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classBoidMath}{BoidMath} (A simple class to contain all relevant mathematical operations for the flocking system so as to aid organisation and to prevent code duplication )}{\pageref{classBoidMath}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classGLWindow}{GLWindow} (Our main glwindow widget for the flocking system all drawing elements are put in this file )}{\pageref{classGLWindow}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classMainWindow}{MainWindow} (Class to connect gui elements to \hyperlink{classGLWindow}{GLWindow} )}{\pageref{classMainWindow}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classObstacle}{Obstacle} (A class to contain all relevant data and methods for an obstacle in a flocking system. The class contains data such as position, radius and colour as well as some simple accessor methods )}{\pageref{classObstacle}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classOctree}{Octree} (A simple, dynamic octree to be used for finding the neighbours of a boid in a flocking system Modifications of the origional source code are to implement ngl vectors as well as the specific data required for the flocking system. It is also modififed so that a leaf node may contain mroe than one data point, this is necessary for its use in the flockign system. This required a major overhaul of the getPointsInsideSphere method )}{\pageref{classOctree}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classPredator}{Predator} (A class to contain all relevant data and methods for a predator in a flocking system. The class contains data such as position, velocity and prey and methods that manipulate this data such as \hyperlink{classPredator_a2e5d5f04490a8c579c1fc7e4b9886828}{setPursiut()}, \hyperlink{classPredator_a8f2a2bec2b92689dbd78a6081269e7cb}{setSteering()} and \hyperlink{classPredator_ac387f969b16cf3651b097f4470368683}{move()}. The predator focuses on one boid in the flock at a time )}{\pageref{classPredator}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classWorld}{World} (A class to contain and manage all the elements of a flocking system. The class is responsible for managing the neighbours of boids, obstacles and to pass messages from the predator to the prey and visa versa. The class also contains functions to preduce preset obstacle courses )}{\pageref{classWorld}}{}
